    "notes": "Vitamin D has to be one of science’s most misunderstood vitamins. For a start, it is not actually a vitamin, but a prohormone, which means that it is converted into a hormone by our body. It is also not just one substance, but five different substances, of which two have been identified as being the most important to humans.~ These are:~Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)~Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).~In addition, research has discovered that vitamin D is not only vital for calcium absorption and bone growth and remodeling, but several other important processes as well, such as modulating cell growth and immune system function. Vitamin D acts on our bones, intestines, kidneys and parathyroid glands to keep calcium in balance throughout our body. Vitamin D receptors are also located within our cardiovascular system, lungs, pancreas, skeletal muscle, skin, and reproductive organs. In summary, vitamin D is a prohormone that is essential for good health. Only 10% of the vitamin D our body needs is obtained from food. The rest is made by our bodies when our skin is exposed to sunlight.~Deficiency: In children a vitamin D deficiency can result in rickets, deformed bones, retarded growth, and soft teeth. In adults a vitamin D deficiency can result in osteomalacia, softened bones, spontaneous fractures, and tooth decay. Those at risk for deficiency include infants, elderly, dark skinned individuals, those with minimal sun exposure, fat malabsorption syndromes, inflammatory bowel diseases, kidney failure, and seizure disorders.Toxicity: Hypervitaminosis D is not a result of sun exposure but from chronic supplementation. Excessive supplement use will elevate blood calcium levels and cause loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst, excessive urination, itching, muscle weakness, joint pain and disorientation. Calcification of soft tissues can also occur.~Sources: Sunlight, fortified foods, mushrooms, salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna, eggs~Pregnancy Category: C~Availability: 20 mcg, 50 mcg capsules",
